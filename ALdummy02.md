The Alleluia repository contains a scoop of partial scores.

The Alleluia repository is a read/write area for developers.
The initial developer is Arthur Lenskold (AL).
A goal is to have the Alleluia repository with some sub-repositories,
and for the Alleluia repository to have one parent repository, Team_d2scor.

The Alleluia repository is an unusual niche.
It is a niche because only a prefix of its lyrics are missing from
the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( Bible ) website.
Therefore the English prefix lyrics for this niche must come
from the Gregorian Missal (Solesmes).
( See the Tempo_FunctionalSpecifications file in the Memos repository ).
